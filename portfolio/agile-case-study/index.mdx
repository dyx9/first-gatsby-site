# Introduction

This academic-year-long team project aims to apply the principles, practices and tools of modern software development, such as Agile methods, requirements engineering, code reviews, and other software-related issues.

# Framework â€” Scrum

We choose the scrum framework as the specific approach to implement the agile method. 

The project life cycle comprises several sprints, with each planned following periodic requirements gathering. During each sprint, team members had a daily scrum meeting, with a discussion of current progress, followed by agile-related activities such as pair programming. After each sprint, a retrospective allowed the team to review that sprint's events, for example, what had been done well and what could be improved. The artefacts include the product backlog, which records a breakdown of work to be done, and a separate list of requirements.
